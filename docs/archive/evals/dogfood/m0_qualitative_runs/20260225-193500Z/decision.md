# Decision (run: 20260225-193500Z)

result: GO
thresholds_passed: true
hard_fail_triggered: false
primary_strengths: reliable citation trustworthiness, strong registry/construction behavior validation, stable strict-hook fail-open protections for expected bootstrap errors
primary_weaknesses: retrieval pipeline complexity/cognitive load, partial relevance on process/meta queries, evidence-manifest hygiene friction
required_followups: #822, #823, #824, #834

## Notes

Execution completed for 12/12 tasks.

Natural-usage matrix artifacts were added for #833:
- `natural_usage_metrics.csv`
- `ablation_replay.csv`
- `tasks/Txx/decision_trace.md` for all 12 tasks.

Natural failure evidence is preserved in real-session artifacts and linked follow-up issue `#834`.
