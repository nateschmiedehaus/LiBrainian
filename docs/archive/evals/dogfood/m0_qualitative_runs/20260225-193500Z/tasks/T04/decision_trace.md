# Decision Trace — T04

- task: Constructable motivation metadata and similarity lookup quality.
- used_librarian: yes
- uncertainty: medium (registry + scoring behavior)
- query_intent: "Extend and validate constructable motivation metadata and similarity lookup quality"
- output_quality: helpful
- what_changed_due_to_librarian: reinforced adding validation checks and tests before metadata expansion.
- counterfactual_without_librarian: possible under-testing of similarity quality invariants.
- follow_up: add benchmark fixture set for motivation similarity drift.
