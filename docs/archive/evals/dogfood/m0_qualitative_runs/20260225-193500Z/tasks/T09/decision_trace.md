# Decision Trace — T09

- task: Explain strategic contracts vs context packs and MCP.
- used_librarian: yes
- uncertainty: high (cross-component architecture intent)
- query_intent: "Explain how strategic contracts relate to context packs and MCP surfacing"
- output_quality: helpful
- what_changed_due_to_librarian: produced clearer separation between persistence/materialization and serving surfaces.
- counterfactual_without_librarian: higher chance of conflating strategic and retrieval pipelines.
- follow_up: add explicit docs bridge between strategic contract layer and MCP exposure.
