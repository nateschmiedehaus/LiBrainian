# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation artifacts that were moved from
`docs/librarian/` as part of the docs consolidation (#863).

These files are **not current documentation**. They are preserved for git history
and reference purposes only. The canonical project documentation lives in:

- `docs/librarian/STATUS.md` -- machine-verified project status
- `docs/librarian/GATES.json` -- gate metrics
- `docs/librarian/DIAGNOSIS_AND_PLAN.md` -- recovery plan
- `docs/librarian/CONVERSATION_INSIGHTS.md` -- strategy tracker
- `docs/librarian/README.md` -- project entry point
- `docs/librarian/ROADMAP.md` -- milestone plan
- `docs/librarian/API.md` -- API reference
- `docs/TEST.md` -- testing policy

Do not add new files to this directory. If you need to create documentation,
add it to `docs/librarian/` or `docs/`.
