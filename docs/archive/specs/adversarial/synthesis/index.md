## Overview

This synthesis document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Universal Coherence System's constructability for epistemic structures relevant to software development and practical reasoning. The analysis is split into navigable parts for easier reference.

The six epistemic primitives (Distinguishability, Content, Grounding, Attitude, Agent, Context) and four operations (CONSTRUCT, RELATE, EVALUATE, REVISE) achieve **QUALIFIED UNIVERSAL CONSTRUCTABILITY** for epistemic structures relevant to software development and practical reasoning.
