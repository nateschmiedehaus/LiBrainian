# Evidence Zones

This document defines where release-relevant claims are allowed and how they must be labeled.

## Zone Types

1. Evidence-backed zone
- Autogenerated region between:
  - `<!-- EVIDENCE_AUTOGEN_START -->`
  - `<!-- EVIDENCE_AUTOGEN_END -->`
- Release-critical metric claims belong here.
- Source of truth is generated evidence artifacts (manifest + reconciliation outputs).

2. Narrative zone
- Human-authored commentary outside the autogen markers.
- Narrative can include context, plans, and interpretation.
- If narrative includes release-relevant claims, it must either:
  - include an explicit evidence reference, or
  - be explicitly marked as `unverified (...)`.

## Guardrail

Use:

```bash
npm run evidence:drift-check
```

The drift guard fails when:
- autogen markers are missing/invalid,
- release-relevant claims appear outside autogen without evidence/unverified context,
- `docs/librarian/GATES.json` shape is invalid for reconciliation.

## Remediation

```bash
npm run evidence:manifest
npm run evidence:reconcile
npm run evidence:drift-check
```
