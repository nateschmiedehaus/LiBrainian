# Internal Docs (Maintainers)

This directory is reserved for maintainer notes that are **not** part of LiBrainian’s public product contract.

## Public vs Internal Boundary

- Public contract: `README.md`, `docs/START_HERE.md`, `docs/librarian/API.md`, `docs/librarian/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/librarian/MCP_SERVER.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Internal-only material should live in private infrastructure, not this public repository.

If a document is needed for package users or first-time adopters, move it to `docs/librarian/` and link it from `docs/README.md`.

Historical orchestration artifacts were intentionally removed from the public repo surface.
