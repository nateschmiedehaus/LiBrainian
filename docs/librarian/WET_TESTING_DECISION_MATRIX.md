# Wet-Testing Decision Matrix (v1)

Status: active  
Schema: `WetTestingDecisionMatrix.v1`  
Source: `src/constructions/processes/wet_testing_policy_research.ts`

## Decision Dimensions

- `riskLevel`: low, medium, high, critical
- `blastRadius`: local, module, cross_module, repo
- `novelty`: known, modified, novel
- `providerDependence`: none, embeddings, llm, mixed
- `releaseCritical`: boolean
- `trigger`: manual, schedule, ci, release
- `executionSurface`: unit, integration, patrol, dogfood, publish
- `userImpact`: none, low, medium, high, blocker
- `requiresExternalRepo`: boolean

## Threshold Rules

1. `critical-release-wet`
- Condition: high+ risk + release critical + CI/release trigger
- Decision: `wet`
- Enforcement: fail-closed

2. `high-impact-patrol-mixed`
- Condition: high-impact patrol/dogfood/publish paths
- Decision: `mixed`
- Enforcement: fail-closed

3. `provider-dependent-mixed`
- Condition: provider-dependent medium+ risk paths
- Decision: `mixed`
- Enforcement: fail-closed

4. `default-dry`
- Condition: all other contexts
- Decision: `dry`
- Enforcement: not fail-closed

## Representative Scenario Set (10)

The canonical scenario fixture is versioned in:
- `src/constructions/processes/wet_testing_policy_research.ts`

Each scenario includes:
- explicit context vector
- expected evidence mode
- expected fail-closed behavior
- rationale text

This fixture is executable and validated by:
- `src/constructions/processes/__tests__/wet_testing_policy_research.test.ts`

## False-Positive / False-Negative Analysis

The research artifact computes:
- `modeMismatchCount`
- `failClosedMismatchCount`
- `overEnforcementRiskCount`
- `underEnforcementRiskCount`

Current baseline evaluation is generated by:
- `evaluateWetTestingPolicyResearch()`
