# Decision Trace — T05

- task: Validate patrol-process registration/discoverability.
- used_librarian: no
- skip_reason: deterministic_edit
- why_skip_was_right: registry assertions and discoverability checks were straightforward and localized.
- what_would_make_librarian_more_useful: direct "show me all registration gaps for this construction id" one-shot command.
- counterfactual: using LiBrainian here would add latency with minimal decision lift.
