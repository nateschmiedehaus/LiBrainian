# Decision Trace — T02

- task: Contract consumer lists appear empty.
- used_librarian: yes
- uncertainty: high (strategic contract persistence + read path)
- query_intent: "Contract consumer lists appear empty in strategic outputs"
- output_quality: helpful
- what_changed_due_to_librarian: validated persistence/read surfaces first; added regression around restart persistence.
- counterfactual_without_librarian: higher chance of patching render layer only.
- follow_up: improve intent mapping for strategic-contract diagnostics.
