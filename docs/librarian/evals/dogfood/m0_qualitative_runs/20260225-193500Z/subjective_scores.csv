T01,4,4,3,4,3,"Diagnosis and fix-path verification were clear, though bootstrap warning semantics still require careful reading."
T02,4,4,4,4,3,"Good context and high trust after source validation; workflow friction from long full-suite runtime and hook/push overhead."
T03,4,4,4,4,4,"Hook-path behavior and non-blocking semantics were clear and test-backed."
T04,4,5,4,4,4,"Constructable motivation coverage and similarity behavior were well-specified and easy to validate."
T05,4,4,4,4,4,"Registry-level patrol-process behavior was straightforward and test-backed."
T06,4,4,4,4,4,"Legacy alias path behaved as expected in CLI run flow with low friction."
T07,5,5,4,5,4,"High clarity and trust from direct code-path verification with explicit storage/index boundaries."
T08,4,4,3,4,3,"Useful analysis but high cognitive load due very large query pipeline and many rerank branches."
T09,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear separation between strategic contract persistence and current MCP/context-pack retrieval surfaces."
T10,4,4,3,4,3,"Diagnosis was reliable but semantic-index warning path still requires nuanced interpretation."
T11,4,4,4,4,4,"Resource-pressure behavior was explicit and mitigation path was deterministic."
T12,5,5,4,5,4,"Failure mechanism was explicit and reproducible once evidence scripts and manifest path were traced."
