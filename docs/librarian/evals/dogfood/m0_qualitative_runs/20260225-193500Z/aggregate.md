# Aggregate metrics (run: 20260225-193500Z)

Status: in progress

## Coverage checks

- Total tasks planned: 12
- Tasks completed: 5
- Bug triage/fix: 3
- Feature extension: 3
- Architecture/navigation: 3
- Test-failure diagnosis: 3
- Unfamiliar tasks planned: 8
- Underspecified prompts planned: 9
- Cross-file tasks planned: 10

## Threshold checks (interim)

- Overall subjective mean >= 4.0: pass (4.12 interim)
- No category mean < 3.5: pass (lowest 3.6 interim)
- Critical trustworthiness incident unresolved: none observed so far
- Hard-fail criteria check: pass so far (no missing artifacts for completed tasks, no fabricated references, no reliability abandonments)

## Interim observation

- Completed tasks: T02, T07, T08, T09, T12
- No invalid references observed in completed tasks.
- Primary friction observed: large retrieval pipeline complexity increases analysis time and cognitive load.
