### Evidence (Manual, 2026-02-12) unverified (evidence_manifest_missing)
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Evidence manifest generated: `state/audits/LiBrainian/manifest.json` (via `npm run evidence:manifest`)
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Evidence reconciliation run: `npm run evidence:reconcile` (autogen block above)
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Ralph loop reports captured under `state/audits/ralph/` (example: `state/audits/ralph/RalphLoopReport.v1_1770380182872.json`)
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): External corpus sync + smoke verify: `node dist/cli/index.js external-repos sync --max-repos 3 --verify --json`
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): External ground truth generation (bounded, memory-stable): `npm run ground-truth:external -- --maxRepos 3`
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Fitness scoring now treats missing retrieval/state measurements as **unmeasured** (masked) rather than scoring them as 0; missing-measurement artifacts are written under `state/audits/evolution/evaluations/<variant>/` when eval is enabled.
- Tier-3 live cognition audit is artifact-backed (writes `LiveCognitionAudit.v1_*.json` under `state/audits/evolution/evaluations/<variant>/cognition/`) and fails closed (`unverified (...)`) when providers or output are invalid.
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-11 A/B bugfix smoke benchmark (reference agent): `npm run eval:ab:agentic-bugfix:reference` → gates passed, agent-command share 100%, report at `eval-results/ab-harness-report.json`.
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-11 live-fire baseline (external repos, objective): `npm run eval:live-fire:baseline` → gates passed, journey/context/blocking rates all met.
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-11 bounded hardcore live-fire showed objective timeout-path behavior in optional mode with fail-closed reasons; smoke now skips after journey timeout and exits cleanly (`smoke_skipped_due_journey_execution_failure`).
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 strict external smoke (full 25-repo manifest) now passes after parser-install runtime hardening:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): `npm run smoke:external:all` → `summary.failures = 0`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Report: `state/eval/smoke/external/all-repos/report.json`
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 parser auto-install now succeeds in environments with constrained default toolchain headers/tmp by setting deterministic install env (`TMPDIR`, `SDKROOT`, `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`) in `installMissingGrammars`.
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 publish-grade A/B scaffolding added for real agent command runs:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Codex wrapper: `scripts/ab-agent-codex.mjs`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Strict command: `npm run eval:ab:agentic-bugfix:codex`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Publish chain: `npm run eval:trial-by-fire:publish`
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 release publish gate remains blocked by strict A/B superiority evidence:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): `npm run eval:publish-gate -- --json` → blocker `release.ab_agentic_bugfix`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): Current strict A/B artifact shows stable execution integrity but insufficient T3+ success lift: `eval-results/ab-harness-report.json`
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 release evidence infrastructure hardened for real-agent realism:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): publish-gate now requires full live-fire run artifacts (pointer + resolvable report), real external corpus roots, multi-repo smoke coverage, and `agent_command`-only A/B evidence.
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): strict script enforcement: `eval:publish-gate` uses `--zero-warning`; `prepublishOnly` now includes `npm run eval:publish-gate`; live-fire hardcore now writes explicit report output path.
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 added broad real-project agentic use-case review harness:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): evaluator: `src/evaluation/agentic_use_case_review.ts`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): runner: `scripts/agentic-use-case-review.ts`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): scripts: `npm run eval:use-cases:agentic`, `npm run eval:use-cases:agentic:quick`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): system test harness: `src/__tests__/agentic_use_case_review.system.test.ts`
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 release qualification chain hardened as a single strict command:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): `npm run test:agentic:strict`
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): includes real agent A/B, progressive use-case review, live-fire, external smoke, and strict publish-gate.
- unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): 2026-02-12 validation checkpoint:
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): `npm test -- --run` -> **9283 passed, 0 failed, 102 skipped**.
  - unverified (evidence_manifest_missing): `npm run test:agentic:strict:quick` -> failed at A/B gate (`t3_plus_ceiling_time_reduction_below_threshold:-0.199<0.050`) with `agentCommandShare=1`, `agentVerifiedExecutionShare=1`, `artifactIntegrityShare=1`, `verificationFallbackShare=0`.

## How to Use This File

1. Only record verified facts with evidence links.
2. Claims without trace are labeled `unverified (<reason>)`.
3. This file is the single source of truth for current status.
4. Each claim MUST include a verification depth and evidence links.
5. Before publish signoff, complete and verify `docs/librarian/CONVERSATION_INSIGHTS.md`.

## Verification Depth Levels

| Level | Definition | Required Evidence |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| `stubbed` | Interface/type exists, implementation is placeholder | Code path only |
| `partial` | Code exists but wiring incomplete or unverified | Code path + integration point |
| `code-reviewed` | Code exists and has been reviewed for correctness | Code path + review trace |
| `tested` | Code exists with passing tests | Code path + test file + assertion |
| `live-verified` | Verified with live providers and audit artifacts | Code path + test + audit artifact |

## Evidence Link Format

Evidence links use the following format:
- **Code**: `src/path/file.ts:functionName` or `src/path/file.ts:L42-L56`
- **Test**: `test/path/file.test.ts:testName`
- **Doc**: `docs/path/file.md#section`
- **Audit**: `state/audits/path/artifact.json`

**Note**: Evidence links should point at `src/**` in the standalone LiBrainian repository. Wave0 shims live in the Wave0 repo. Legacy `packages/LiBrainian/**` references are pending migration (unverified (extraction_link_migration_pending)).

### Bootstrap & Indexing

**Bootstrap Mode Note**: Bootstrap defaults to `fast` mode which skips LLM-based ingestion sources (commits, docs enrichment). For complete knowledge including commit history and semantic doc summaries, use `--mode full`:
```bash
LiBrainian bootstrap --mode full
```
This requires live LLM providers and takes longer but produces comprehensive knowledge.

## Known Gaps (Ordered by Priority)

### Critical (Violates Core Mandate)

1. **LLM Evidence Missing for File/Directory Semantic Records**
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/knowledge/extractors/file_extractor.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/knowledge/extractors/directory_extractor.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/storage/sqlite_storage.ts`
   - Violation: Understanding mandate evidence requirements in `docs/LiBrainian/UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md#understanding-mandate-llm-required`
   - Required Fix: Store per-record LLM evidence (provider/modelId/promptDigest/timestamp) for file/directory semantic fields (or mark those fields `unverified (...)` when evidence is absent)
   - Status: Universal knowledge semantic extractors now carry `meta.llmEvidence`; file/directory record schema does not yet carry LLM evidence

2. **Timeout Policy Not Enforced**
   - Location: `src/soma/providers/llm_service.ts`
   - Violation: Waiting policy (no timeouts unless explicit)
   - Required Fix: Remove default timeouts, add explicit timeout parameters
   - Status: Default timeouts set to 0 (waiting); explicit timeout parameters available

### High (Affects Correctness) - RESOLVED

3. ~~**Method Packs Not Evidence-Backed**~~
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/methods/method_pack_service.ts`
   - **RESOLVED 2026-01-08**: Added `MethodPackEvidence` interface with provider, modelId, promptDigest, durationMs
   - Evidence: `packages/LiBrainian/src/methods/method_pack_service.ts:MethodPackEvidence`

4. ~~**Multi-Vector Scoring Unverified**~~
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/api/query.ts`
   - **RESOLVED 2026-01-08**: Added `RetrievalQualityReport.v1` artifact and verification tests
   - Evidence: `packages/LiBrainian/src/measurement/retrieval_quality.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/__tests__/multi_vector_verification.test.ts`

5. ~~**Co-Change Edges Not Computed at Bootstrap**~~
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/graphs/temporal_graph.ts`
   - **RESOLVED**: Implemented via `buildTemporalGraph` in `runRelationshipMapping` bootstrap phase
   - Evidence: `packages/LiBrainian/src/api/bootstrap.ts:runRelationshipMapping`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/__tests__/co_change_signals.test.ts`

### Medium (Affects Completeness) - PARTIALLY RESOLVED

6. ~~**UC x Method x Scenario Coverage Unvalidated**~~
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/cli/commands/coverage.ts`
   - **RESOLVED 2026-01-08**: Implemented `LiBrainian coverage --strict` with evidence tracking
   - Evidence: `packages/LiBrainian/src/cli/commands/coverage.ts`, `state/audits/LiBrainian/coverage/uc_method_scenario_matrix.json`
   - Output: `UCMethodScenarioMatrix.v1` with per-UC summaries, evidence sources, and strict mode validation

7. ~~**Knowledge Maps Not Integrated**~~
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/api/context_assembly.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/knowledge/synthesizer.ts`
   - **RESOLVED 2026-01-08**: Added explicit `mapCodes` and `category` fields to `KnowledgeSourceRef`
   - Evidence: `packages/LiBrainian/src/api/context_assembly.ts:KnowledgeSourceRef`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/knowledge/synthesizer.ts:buildKnowledgeSources`

8. ~~**Cross-Repo Federation Not Implemented**~~
   - Location: `packages/LiBrainian/src/federation/`
   - **RESOLVED 2026-01-08**: Implemented federation protocol with:
     - `FederationRegistry` for managing multiple repositories
     - `FederatedQueryExecutor` for cross-repo queries
     - Provenance tracking and trust levels
     - Safe query boundaries and timeout handling
   - Evidence: `packages/LiBrainian/src/federation/types.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/federation/registry.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/federation/query.ts`, `packages/LiBrainian/src/__tests__/federation.test.ts`
