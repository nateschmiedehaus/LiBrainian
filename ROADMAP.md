# Roadmap

## Deferred: Federation Runtime Surface

- The `src/federation/` module is maintained as internal development work.
- Federation runtime artifacts are intentionally excluded from the public npm tarball until:
  - remote transport and discovery are production-ready,
  - trust/auth semantics are end-to-end tested,
  - the public API surface is explicitly documented.
